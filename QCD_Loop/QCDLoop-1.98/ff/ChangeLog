The ff library is taken from van Oldenborgh. We treat it as a black box 
	and has not been modified by us. At the suggestion of jacek.m.holeczek@gmail.com
	we have made two modifications to facilitate compilation with 
	modern fortran compilers, which do greater checks on array sizes.
	
        * ffxd0p.f:
	       removed calls to ffcxra and ffxtra with the penultimate argument ii=3
	       (both of these routines have as their first executable statement 
	       "if ( ii .eq. 3 ) return", so this is clearly innocuous
	        
        * aaxex.f:
	       for similar reasons changed the second argument of the call to mdxi 
	       call ffeji(cdxi,mdxi,ccxi,mcxi,cbxi,mbxi,caxi,maxi,
	      +		cdxj,mdxj,ccxj,mcxj,cbxj,mbxj,caxj,maxj,level)
               this routine is never called, so this is also innocuous
